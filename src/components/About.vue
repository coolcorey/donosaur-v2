        You can donate to a non-profit so easily today, but that ease comes with a cost. Most transaction handlers shave 4-7% off of each donation, meaning that less of your donation goes to your nonprofit of choice. Donosaur, on the other hand, doesn't steal even a penny. Using PayPal to transact donations, each non-profit gets every cent you send, minus PayPal's minimum required processing fee of 2.2% + 30 cents.
